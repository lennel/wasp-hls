# WaspHlsPlayer documentation

Welcome to our documentation pages.

Documentation pages are written in markdown and can be found in the following
directories:

  - `Getting_Started`: documentation pages allowing to learn to use the
    WaspHlsPlayer step-by-step.

    This is the directory to go to when trying to first rely on this project.

  - `API` (TODO): Exhaustive documentation of all WaspHlsPlayer's API

    This is the directory to go to when wanting to read the exact actions each
    API will do.
